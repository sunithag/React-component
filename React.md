Why React?

1)  Modular architecture for creating reusable web components

2) Performance gain (handle DOM batch manipulation, prevent memory leak)

3) Declarative code style (Easier to read & maintain)

4) Server and client side rendering

5) Markup + display logic tied together which may result in slimmer bundle.

6) Virtual DOM diffing and updating

7) Componentized UI is the future of web development, and you need to start doing it now.

8) Open the door to use native apps for iOS/android with React native.
