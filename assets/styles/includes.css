Responsive Breakpoints

We use five major breakpoints in Atlas. These breakpoints are primarily meant
for use in `min-width` "mobile-first" media queries:

```
// Applies to screens wider than or equal to 768px.

.component {
  @media (min-width: $breakpoint-m) {
    display: inline-block;
    border-radius: 4px;
  }
}
```

In cases where `max-width` "desktop-first" media queries are necessary, use the
accompanying `-max` variants of the breakpoint media queries:

```
// Applies to screens more narrow than the "large" breakpoint of 1024px.

.component {
  @media (max-width: $breakpoint-m-max) {
    display: inline-block;
    border-radius: 4px;
  }
}
```

Each `-max` variable is 1px more narrow than the *next largest* breakpoint, preventing
overlap between `min-width` and `max-width` media queries.

|                        | Default               | Extra Small           |  Small               | Medium              | Large               | Extra Large         |
| :---------------       | :--------             | :--                   | :----------          | :----------         | :----------         | :-----------        |
| **Screen Sizes**       | `< 320px`             | `>= 320px`            | `>= 480px`           | `>= 768px`          | `>= 1024px`         | `>= 1364px`         |
| **Variable**           | None                  | `$breakpoint-xs`      | `$breakpoint-s`      | `$breakpoint-m`     | `$breakpoint-l`     | `$breakpoint-xl`    |
| **Max-width Variable** | None                  | `$breakpoint-xxs-max` | `$breakpoint-xs-max` | `$breakpoint-s-max` | `$breakpoint-m-max` | `$breakpoint-l-max` |

Deprecated: Responsive Breakpoints

These variables are deprecated in favor of the new breakpoint set above.

We use four major breakpoints in Atlas. These breakpoints are primarily meant
for use in `min-width` "mobile-first" media queries:

```
// Applies to screens wider than or equal to than 768px.

.component {
  @media (min-width: $screen-m) {
    display: inline-block;
    border-radius: 4px;
  }
}
```

In cases where `max-width` "desktop-first" media queries are necessary, use the
accompanying `-max` variants of the breakpoint media queries:

```
// Applies to screens more narrow than the "large" breakpoint of 768px.

.component {
  @media (max-width: $screen-m-max) {
    display: inline-block;
    border-radius: 4px;
  }
}
```

Each `-max` variable is 1px more narrow than the *next largest* breakpoint, preventing
overlap between `min-width` and `max-width` media queries.

|                        | Default (Small) | Medium          | Large           | Extra Large     | Extra Extra Large |

/*
Spacing

Spacing between and within different elements can be achieved with the
`-margin` and `-padding` variables. This ensures consistent spacing throughout
the page, and opens up the process for responsive spacing in the (near)
future.

Each variable is a non-responsive, fixed unit.

For ease of moving different components around the page using `margin`,
see [Modules and Margins](#3-modules-and-margins).

```
// Applies 30px to the top margin and 5px to the left margin, and
// applies 10px padding on all sides.

.component {
  margin-top: $m-margin;
  margin-left: $xxs-margin;
  padding: $xs-padding;
}
```

|                        | Extra Extra Small | Extra Small    | Small          | Medium          | Large        | Extra Large    | Extra Extra Large |
| :---------------       | :--------         | :----------    | :----------    | :----------     | :----------- | :----------    | :-----------      |
| **Size**               | `4px`             | `12px`         | `20px`         | `32px`          | `40px`       | `48px`         | `60px`            |
| **Margin variable**    | `$xxs-margin`     | `$xs-margin`   | `$s-margin`    | `$m-margin`     | `$l-margin`  | `$xl-margin`    | `$xxl-margin`    |
| **Padding variable**   | `$xxs-padding`    | `$xs-padding`  | `$s-padding`   | `$m-padding`    | `$l-padding` | `$xl-padding`   | `$xxl-padding`   |

Mixins

*/
/*
wmzindex()

We name every `z-index` and use them with the `wmzindex()` mixin. This lets
us keep track of all z-indices used so that there is no guesswork about
order. For more information, see http://css-tricks.com/handling-z-index/

To add a `z-index`, refer to the `$wmzindex` list in `variables.styl` and
create a new z-index with the desired stacking order.

Most z-indices are named for their component. There are also several utility
indices which cover common use cases:

- `"negative"`: Sets `z-index: -1` to place content behind the normal flow.
- `"none"`: Resets `z-index` to `0`.
- `"basic"`: Sets `z-index: 1` to place content in front of the normal flow.
- `"basic-increment"`: Sets `z-index: 2` to place content in front of
 elements with a `"basic"` `z-index`.

To use, call `wmzindex()` with a name. `wmzindex("basic")` will return
`z-index: 1;`.

/*
font-smoothing()

The `font-smoothing()` mixin applies `-webkit-font-smoothing` and
`-moz-osx-font-smoothing` to adjust font smoothing behavior on OS X browsers
(Chrome, Safari, Opera, and Firefox). Best used on icon fonts and large text.

The mixin applies `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` and
`-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale` by default. You can pass in `"off"` as
a parameter to set these values back to their browser defaults, or
`"inherit"` to set them to `inherit`.

*/
/*
css3pie()

The `css3pie()` mixin adds basic CSS3 support for IE7+. Do not use this on
`*` as it has a substantial performance impact. It should only be used on
a case-by-case basis.

For more details, see http://css3pie.com/

*/
/*
svgBg()

The `svgBg()` mixin sets an SVG background image with a Modernizr fallback.
*/
/*
blinktext()

The `blinktext()` mixin applies a 'blinking' animation indefinitely, most
commonly used to the make an ellipsis blink.

Styleguide 15.4
*/
/*
clearfix()

The `clearfix()` mixin clears any `float` beahvior, allowing
the component to stack horizontally neatly.

The `clearfix()` mixin applies `display: table` and `content: ""` on the
pseudo elements `&:before` and `&:after`, avoiding the collapsed
height effect of floats. Additionally, it applies `clear: both` to the
`&:after` pseudo element to allow horizontal stacking.

*/
/*
ir()

Deprecated: This component is deprecated. Do not use it in old or new
projects. Pages using it may break at any time.

The mixin `ir()` is used for image replacement. Apply the mixin to
an element and add a background image, so that there is accessible text,
but it displays an image for sighted users.

The preferred solution to use instead is to wrap the accessible text in
a `<span class="visuallyhidden"></span>`.

Styleguide 15.6
*/
/*
visuallyhidden()

We use the `visuallyhidden()` mixin when content should be made availble
to screen readers users, but kept hidden from sighted users.

The `visuallyhidden()` mixin positions content off the visible screen using
`position: absolute;` to remove the element from the page flow.
It applies `width: 1px; height: 1px;` to make the
element a one-pixel square in size and uses `overflow: hidden` to
visually hide everything that does not fit in these dimensions. A negative
margin, `margin: -1px;`, and a clip, `clip: rect(0 0 0 0)`, is applied to
define what portion of an element is visible while avoiding any page
scrolling.

Styleguide 15.7
*/
/*
ellipsis()

The `ellipsis()` mixin truncates a single line of text to an ellipsis (...)
when it is too long. It applies `white-space: nowrap`, which means
it will not work on a paragraph of text.

Styleguide 15.8
*/
/*
horizontal-dotted-border()

The `horizontal-dotted-border()` mixin applies a horizontal border.
The horizontal border has a repeating pattern of 1 gray and 2
transparent pixels, resulting in a visually aesthetic separator line.

*/
/*
img-hide-alt()

The `img-hide-alt()` mixin is for hiding the alt-text in
certain browsers (i.e. Firefox) since we have limited space the alt-text
will go all over the place.

Styleguide 15.10
*/
/*
remify()

The `remify($values)` mixin takes a `px` value and converts it to `rem`. It also
adds a `px` fallback for old browsers. All font sizing should use this mixin,
unless there is a particular use case in which an element should be sized with
`em` values instead.

`remify()` accepts multiple values, allowing for shorthand declarations. For
example, the following is valid: `padding: remify(20px 16px)`.

Styleguide 15.11
*/
/*
emify()

The `emify($value)` mixin takes a `px` value and converts it to `em`. `emify()`
should only be used when adding minor breakpoints, because `rem` values cannot
be used in breakpoints. In all other cases, use `remify()` instead.

*/
/*
absolute-center()

The `absolute-center()` mixin centers an element vertically and horizontally.

To use, the containing element must have a `position` value of `relative`,
`absolute`, or `fixed` and the element to be centered must have a fixed height
if you want to center it vertically.

Styleguide 15.13
*/
/*
absolute-center-h()

The `absolute-center()` mixin centers an element horizontally.

To use, the containing element must have a `position` value of `relative`,
`absolute`, or `fixed`.

/*
absolute-center-v()

The `absolute-center()` mixin centers an element vertically.

To use, the containing element must have a `position` value of `relative`,
`absolute`, or `fixed` and the element to be centered must have a fixed height
if you want to center it vertically.

/*
breakpoint()

The `breakpoint()` mixin is used for `min-` and `max-width` media queries.
It conditionally wraps code in media queries depending on the value of the
`$isResponsive` variable. This allows us to generate fallback stylesheets that
apply desktop screen styles without media queries.

`breakpoint()` takes two parameters:

- `$width`: a `px` or `em` width for the media query
- `$type`: the type of media query, `min` (default) or `max`

Pixel widths are automatically converted to `em` values.

`breakpoint()` is a block mixin. Example usage:

```
+breakpoint($breakpoint-m) {
  body {
    background: blue;
  }
}
```
